			<p>
				Exocet is a soluving algorithm that combines constraints such as house, locked, and coverline.
				Here is an explanation of how Exocet works.
				The following explanation assumes knowledge of Exocet terms and definitions.
				If you are unfamiliar with it, please refer to <a href="page59A_JE2.html">Junior Exocet</a>. <br><br>

				<i>[Provisional version] This section may contain ambiguities or errors.
					Please don't just take it at face value, but read it critically.<br>
					The GNPX V6 application project(C#) will also be helpful for understanding.
				</i>

			<H3 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(1)Select Base and CrossLines ... (basic) Senior Exocet</H3>
			<p>
				<ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;">
					<li>&nbsp;1) Select any cell(Stem Cell) and direction(row direction/column direction)</li>
					<li>&nbsp;2) Determine two Base cells in the same block as the Stem.
								The Base cells are in the same miniline as the Stem, and both are undetermined cells. </li>
					<li>&nbsp;3) Determine CrossLine0 by the Stem and cross direction.
								Select CrossLine-1 from CrossBand-1. Select CrossLine-2 from CrossBand-2. <br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Band is a collection of Blocks with the same direction)</li>
				</ul>

			</p>

			<H3 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(2) Select Target/Object</H3>
			<p>
				<ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;">
					<li>&nbsp;1) Select two Targets/Objects on CrossLine-0, CrossLine-1, and CrossLine-2.
						Since the selection is done by 2/3, there are no Objects on one CrossLine.
						(In the following, we will use Object. Target is a 1-cell Object.)	
					</li>
					<li>&nbsp;2) The object is in one block.</li>
				</ul>

			</p>


			<H3 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(3) Sline, Companion</H3>
			<p>
				Companion dictates that the following logic hold:<br>
				・ The Base digits are located in the part of the CrossLine other than the SLine.<br>
				・ Object and Companion are in the non-SLine parts of the CrossLine.<br>
				・ Companion does not have a Base digits, therefore Object has a Base digits.<br>

				<ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;">
					<li>&nbsp;1) Companion are the cells where the CrossLine and the Object's ParallelHouse intersect.</li>
					<li>&nbsp;2) Determine the SLine from the CrossLine, Object, and Companion.<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SLine = CrossLine - (Object &cup; CompanionCompanion)  (&cup;:union set  &nbsp;-:difference set)
					</li>
				</ul>

			<H3 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(4) Exocet conditions</H3>
			<p>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;When the following R1-R4 are met, the Base digits is in the Target/Object.

						<td class="table_itemName" style="width: 5%" >R1</td>
						<td class="table_item">&nbsp;The base cells (B1, B2) are both undetermined cells, contain the same numbers, 
							and the number of Base's ​​is 3 or 4 (#abc/#abcd).</td>

					<tr>
						<td class="table_itemName" style="width: 5%" >R1</td>
						<td class="table_item">&nbsp;A Base cell with a Base digits of 2 is a LockedSet. 
							A Base digita of 5 or more is a prediction that "there will be more constraints, and probably none."<br>
							&nbsp;Therefore, the number of Base's ​​is 3 or 4</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="table_itemName" >R2</td>
						<td class="table_item">&nbsp;Target/Object may contain candidate digits other than the Base digits.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="table_itemName">R3</td>
						<td class="table_item" style="width: 90%" >&nbsp;Companion cells can be either fixed or unfixed. <br>
							The absence of a Base digits in the Companion implies that the Object has a Base digits.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="table_itemName">R4</td>
						<td class="table_item">&nbsp;If the S area is "confirmed, resolved", it can be interpreted as either "Parallel/Cross Cover Line".

			<h4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(5) Exocet logic ... Proof of Locked</h4>
			<p>
				Base digits that satisfy R1 to R4 are Locked. <br>
				When any two digits are selected from the Base candidate digits, the following proposition holds for these two digits. <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Proposition: If it is positive in Base, it is also positive in Object1 and Object2.</b><br>

				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;"><b>Proof</b>
					<li>L1. In the Base cell, the base digits #ab is positive.</li>
					<li>L2. In the S area (SLine-0, SLine-1, SLine-2), there are three instances of #ab each (according to the rules of Sudoku), 
						for a total of six instances.</li>
					<li>L3. From R3, there is no instance of #ab in Companion.</li>
					<li>L4. From R4, there are two #a CoverLines and two #b CoverLines in the S region {SLine-0, SLine-1, SLine-2}.</li>
					<li>L5. Since "6-4=2", the #a and #b instances are in Object1 and Object2, respectively.<br>
						(#a and #b cannot exist in the same Object at the same time. It is not certain which is which.)</li>
				</ol>
			</p><br><br><br>


			<h4 id="head_bg_Blue">&nbsp;Extended Exocet</h4>

			<h4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(1) Single Exocet</h4>
			<p>
				A Single Exocet is a case where one of the Objects <b>"cannot have a Base digits" = "confirmed cell(s)"</b>.<br>
				The Base cell, Base digits, and CrossLine settings are the same as the standard Exocet.<br>
				The following figure is an example. One Object is a fixed cells, and the shape of the SLine and Companion at that time.<br>
				Whether these patterns actually exist remains to be seen.
				The rightmost pattern is an invalid pattern in which no candidate digits can be placed.<br>
				The Object and Companion settings are the same as in a standard Exocet.

			<p>
				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;"><b>Conditions for Single Exocet</b>
					<li>1) Among the Base digits, one candidate digits has three CoverLines in the S region (this is called "wildcard"). </li>
					<li>2) Base digits other than the wildcard cover the S region with two CoverLines. </li>
					<li>3) In a normal Object, all Bases, including the wildcard, are candidates (other digits may also be included. </li>
				</ol><br>
				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;"><b>Results of Single Exocet</b>
					<li>1) In the Base, the wildcard is positive. </li>
					<li>2) In a normal Object, the wildcard is positive. </li>
					<li>3) In a cell that connects the Base and a normal Object, the candidate number wildcard is negative. </li>

			<h4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;(2) Single-Base Exocet</h4>
			<p>
				Single-Base Exocet is a case where the Base of a Single Exocet is <b>1 cell</b>.<br>

			<H3 id="head_bg_Blue">&nbsp;Additional Information (for understanding Exocet)</H3>
			<H4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;The logic of the Exocet algorithm</H4>
			<p>
				Exocet is an algorithm that is somewhat difficult to understand its mechanism and effects, as it combines several logics.
				For the same reason, the Exocet family can be expanded in various ways by replacing or extending the mechanism.<br>

				The following diagram shows one of the logics used in Exocet.
				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;"><b>One of the mechanisms of Exocet</b>
					<li>1) In a Sudoku house, a number from 1 to 9 (for example, #a) is positive in only one place. </li>
					<li>2) When the house is divided into three areas, if #a is not in area C, it is in area A or area B. If it is not in areas A and C,
						it is in area B. </li>
					<li>3) When applied to the elements of Exocet, A, B, and C become SLine, Object, and [Escape, Companion], respectively. </li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<H4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;Companion</H4>
			<p>
				Companion is an area that does not contain candidate digits in Base. <br>
				<b>The constraints of the S-Area</b> and the fact that <b>there are no Base digits in Companion</b> lead to the conclusion that <b>there are candidate digits in Object</b>.
				Companion, together with the covering conditions of the S-Area, plays a role in the establishment of Exocet.

			<H4 id="head_bg_Light2Blue">&nbsp;Mirror</H4>
			<p>
				Exocet Mirror has different functions and roles from other components. <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Mirror is not involved in the establishment of Exocet Locked. <br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;Mirror is defined when Exocet-Locked is established, and exclusion by Mirror occurs. </b><br>
