			<p>
				Exocet is a "different type of Locked" from other algorithms, and is a fascinating and profound algorithm. <br>
				There are a wide variety of situations that it can be applied to and number patterns that can be excluded,
				and some situations can be solved with Exocet alone. <br>
				The addition of Exocet, a new powerful algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles, 
				has opened up new directions for analytical algorithms.
				It foreshadows the discovery of even more new methods.<br><br>

				There are various types of Exocet, from basic and simple types to extended types, and Exocet is the general term for them.<br>
				Exocet uses somewhat complicated logic. First, let's look at the basic types.<br>
				The first one is Junior Exocet (JE2). <br>
				<br>
				<span style="color:red">JExocet sample ...</span><br><br>

			<a id="ID_JE2"></a>
			<h4 id="head_bg_Blue">&nbsp;Definition of JExocet ... for JE2</h4>
			<p>
				JExocet is <span style="color:Blue">Locked</span> due to the relationship between <b>Base, S area, and Target</b>. <br><br>
				The two cells in Base have two or more candidate digits.
				If there are two, it is a LockSet, so three or more.

				JExocet lock: Any two digits selected from the candidate digits will be positive in T<small>1</small> and T<small>2</small>.
				</span><br><br>
				<img src="images/img59/image59_Exocet_Base.svg" style="margin-left: 40px;" width="40%" ><br><br>

				JExocet Locked is based on the <b></b>shape definition</b> and <b>candidate digit conditions</b> shown below.<br><br>
			</p>



			<h4 id="head_bg_LightBlue">&nbsp;(1) JE2 shape definition</h4>
			
			<p>
				Exocet has multiple role cells, arranged as shown in the following diagram:
				<ul style="padding-left:20px;" >
					<li>There are two types of target cell arrangement: diagonal and aligned.</li>
					<li>Companion cells and Mirror cells are placed in relation to the position of the Target cell.</li>
					<li>Escape(*) is a cell where no Base candidate digits exist.</li>
				</ul>
				The diagonal and aligned types are classifications for determining cell placement,
				and the following logic is the same.<br><br>
				<img src="images/img59/image59_Exocet_def01.svg" style="margin-left: 40px;" width="70%" ><br>
			</p>

			<p style="background-color:rgba(203, 232, 255, 0.5) ">
				*To understand how Exocet works, it's helpful to distinguish between <b>directions</b>.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Base alignment</b> is used as the reference, and the direction parallel to this is <b>Parallel</b>.<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp;and the direction that crosses it is <b>Cross</b>. These are often omitted when it is clear from the context.<br>
			</p>

			<p>
				The shape of JExocet can be derived in the following steps (for JE2). 
				These steps can also be used as a reference for creating the solution code for JExocet.
				<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
					<li>Step 1: Select one cell (Stem cell) on the board and the direction (row, column). This determines the mini-line. <br>
						The two Base (B1, B2) cells, Band, and two blocks (Block1, Block2) of the mini-line are determined.
						The Cross-Line-b (S<small>0</small>) is also determined by the Stem cell and direction.
						<p style="background-color:rgba(203, 232, 255, 0.5) ">
						*A mini-line is three cells in a row or column within a block. <br>
						*The Stem cell is used to guide the shape and is not involved in the definition or logic of the Exocet.
						The Stem cell can be either fixed(given/solved) or unfixed. <br>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Step 2: There are 6 cells in each of blocks 1 and 2 that are not connected to the Base.
						From each block, select a Target cell with an undetermined number (T1, T2). <br>
						The Companion cell, Mirror cell, Cross-Line-x, S<small>1</small>, and S<small>2</small> 
						are determined from the direction and the Target cell (T1, T2).
						These cells can be in either a fixed or unfixed state. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<img src="images/img59/image59_Exocet_def02.svg" style="margin-left: 40px;" width="70%"><br><br>
			



			<h4 id="head_bg_LightBlue">&nbsp;(2) JE2 candidate digit conditions</h4>
			<p>
				Based on the definition of the JExocet shape, the following conditions (R1 to R4) are tested for the Base digits. <br>
				When there are two or more digits that pass the test, <b>the candidate digits that meet the R1 to R4 conditions are marked as Locked</b>. <br>
				In addition, candidate digits that meet the R1 to R4 conditions are referred to as "Locked digits".<br><br>

				<b>JE2 Conditions for candidate digits</b>
				<table class="table1" style="border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid #000099; width: 95%;" >
					<tr>
						<td class="table_itemName" style="width: 5%" >R1</td>

							and have a total base digits of 3 or 4 (#abc/#abcd).</td>

						<td class="table_item">The target cells(T1, T2) are both unfixed cells and together have two or more base digits.</td>

					</tr>
				</table><br>
				If two or more Base digits satisfy R1 to R4, JExocet Locked is established. <br><br>
				The following <b>exclusion</b> checks the position and number of digits to find and exclude irrational states and candidate digits.
			</p>




			<h4 id="head_bg_LightBlue">&nbsp;(3) JExocet logic ... Proof of Locked</h4>
			<p>
				Base digits that satisfy R1 to R4 are Locked.<br>
				When any two digits are selected from the Base candidate digits, the following proposition holds for these two digits.<br>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Proposition: If it is positive in Base, then it is also positive in Target1 and Target2.</b><br><br>

				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:10px;"><>Proof of JE2 Locked</b>  (CL:Cross-Line)
					<li>L1. In the Base cell, the base digits #ab is positive.</li>
					<li>L2. CL-b, CL-1, and CL-2 each have three instances of #ab (Sudoku rules), for a total of six instances.</li>
					<li>L3. From R4, S cell (S0, S1, S2) has two #a CoverLines and two #b CoverLines.</li>
					<li>L4. Because "6-4=2", there are instances of #a and #b in the Band area of ​​CL-1 and CL-2.</li>
					<li>L5. The #a and #b instances are not in Escape or Companion, so they are in Target1 and Target2, respectively. 
						(It is not clear which one.)</li>
				</ol>

				As stated in the Bird document,
				it is important to note that there are prerequisites for the application of the exclusion rule.<br><br>

						In the case of Locked, the Target candidate digit also include "locked digits but non-determined digits",

						The following inference (contrapositive) is true. <br>

			<h4 id="head_bg_Blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluded type-3</h4>
			<p>
				Exclusion-3 is an exclusion based on two Base digits. In Bird's documentation, this is the "Incomtible Base Pairs" section. <br>
				The candidate digits in the two bases are free combinations and are not candidates for the Base digits.<br>
				For example, if the candidate digits in the base are (1,2,3), the combinations are {(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,1),(3,1)(3,2)}.
				Also, if the candidates in the two Bases are different, this is a possible combination pattern. <br>

				<br>
				Test each of these combinations. Due to the nature of Exocet, we use the following:
				<ol style="padding-left:2pc;">
					<li>The Base digits to be tested are in Target.</li>
					<li>The instances of the two Base digits are in S0. The instances may be confirmed.</li>
					<li>The two Cross-Blocks of the two Base Cells have Base digits in the candidate state.</li>
				</ol>
				
				There are three cases of instances in S<small>0</small>:
				<ol style="list-style:none; padding-left:1pc;">
					<li>Case-1: Instances in S0 of two Base digits are in the same cell. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						This pattern is not possible as a Sudoku solution, so this combination pattern can be excluded.
					</li>
					<br>

					<li>Case-2: Instances in S<small>0</small> of two Base digits are in the same Cross-Block. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						This pattern eliminates all Base digits in the Cross-Block. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It has no effect on the other Cross-Block. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, this combination is in a Base-UR relationship, and <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This combination pattern can be excluded due to the uniqueness of the Sudoku solution. 
					</li>
					<br>

					<li>Case-3: The instances in S0 of the two Base digits are in different Cross-Blocks. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This pattern eliminates each Base digit in each Cross-Block. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, it will not be Base and UR. <br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, this combination pattern remains a possible solution.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p style="background-color:rgb(203, 232, 255) ">
					"Excluded type-3" detects ineligible base digit combinations, which updates the "known base digits".
					This may expand the areas where the exclusion rule can be applied. <br>
					For this reason, GNPX tests "Exclusion type-3" before "Exclusion type-1,2".
